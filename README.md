# Dockerfile CMD Instruction Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: an incorrect or missing `CMD` instruction.

The original `Dockerfile` attempts to run a Python application, but the `CMD` instruction points to a file that doesn't exist within the image.

The `DockerfileSolution.txt` shows the corrected version, ensuring the application's entrypoint is properly defined.

This example highlights the importance of precisely specifying the path to your application executable or script when defining the `CMD` instruction in your `Dockerfile`.
